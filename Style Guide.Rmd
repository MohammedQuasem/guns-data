Good coding style is an improtant communication tool. I may understand every part of my code as I understant why did things a certain way however when others have to follow my footsteps establishing style guide will be essential for consistency and clear communication. My style guide is based on Googleâ€™s R guide style.


### File

File names should end in .R

Example:

#Good

Style.R

Exercise1.R

#Bad

Style.r

Exercise1.r

If files have the same name indicate version by underscore

Gender_2012.R

Gender_2019.R

### Obeject Names

Variable and function names will be lowercase. I will make names that are concise and easy to understand.

#Good

data_1a

Ex_1a

#Bad

Data1a

Ex1a


I will avoid using existing names in R

#Bad

T<-mean(data1$velocity)

F<-sd(data1$jump)

#Good

mean_jump<-mean(data1$jump)

stdev_jump<-sd(data1$jump)

### Syntax

#Spacing 

I will put spaces around all operators and space after comma.

#Good

z_score_jump<- (data1$jump - mean_jump) / stdev_jump

#Bad

z_score_jump<-(data1$jump - mean_jump)/stdev_jump


#Good

jump_average <- mean(data1$jump / length(data1$jump) + inches, na.rm = TRUE)

#Bad

jump_average<-mean(data1$jump/length(data1$jump)+inches,na.rm=TRUE)

### Line Length

I will do my best not to exceed the 80 character length per line.

### Assignment

I will use <- not =

#Good

jump<- data1$jump

#Bad

jump= data1$jump

### Comment

I will use # and space to comment on what the line of code is doing

#Good


:# This code is calculating the z score for the jump variable in Data1 and
storing the z scores as z_score_jump

z_score_jump<- (data1$jump - mean_jump) / stdev_jump

### Chunks

I will break down the codes into smaller chunks.

I will run the chunks by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.
